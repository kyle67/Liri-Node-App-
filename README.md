LIRI Bot Assignment

Create a CLI App "LIRI" bot which stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Solution
The solution was to use "backend" technologies only. Node.js was used along with NPM (Node Package Manager) libraries in order to accomplish the tasks. There is no front end to this application, therefore this is no html page to publish.

Technologies
JavaScript, Node.js, Request library, Spotify API, dateFormat library, File system library
